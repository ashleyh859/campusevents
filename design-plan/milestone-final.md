# Project 3, Final Milestone: Design Journey

[← Table of Contents](design-journey.md)


**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class (includes the design prerequisite for this course).**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality.


## Self-Reflection
> Reflect on what you learned during this assignment. How have you improved from the previous project? What would you do differently next time? (2-3 sentences)

I feel like in this assignment, we were able to use the concepts we learned in class and then apply in an extended way in our projects. I felt like in the previous assignment, what we did in class was applicable to our project milestone, but for this one, we had to branch out and apply these concepts, which was sometimes challenging but very rewarding once I figure it out! I also am more confortable with looking at documentation! Next time, I hope to maybe create my own website and hopefully speed up the process haha!
